# Chapter 1 The Value of Data Visualization

In the following section, I highlight the value of data visualizations, which is caused by an increasing availability of data. I highlight these values by different typical examples from data visualizations.

When thinking about the value of data visualization we should consider the increasing importance of data in our society. Over the last century the availability of data in the world is growing exponentially. We now have data whose scope is no longer imaginable.

According to statista[^1] the total amount of data reached almost 65 zettabytes in 2020 {cite}`statista2021`. This growth was higher than previously expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as more and more people work and study from home and make more use of home entertainment options. However, in 2020, the installed storage capacity reached 6.7 zettabytes, thus, only a small proportion of the created data was kept. During the forecast period from 2020 to 2025, statista states an average annual growth rate of 19.2 % in storage capacity {cite}`statista2021`.

Just to recall, a zettabyte is a unit of measurement for storage capacity and stands for 10^21 bytes. That’s trillions of bytes, or in numbers, 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. This in turn is equal to 1,000 exabytes or one billion terabytes.

Besides the aforementioned data that are created by using social media, there are many other types of data that contributed to the need for higher storage capacity. Just to give you some examples of available data: there are geographical, cultural, scientific, financial, statistical, meteorological, natural, and transport data.

Even though, we have all these data available, already in 1999 Edward O. Wilson concluded (Wilson 1999): > “We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. > The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information > at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely. > It went a lot faster with two people digging.”

This quote nicely summarize the challenges we face in data visualization. Even though, we have a lot of data available it turns out that we need the ‘’right information’’ at the ‘’right time’‘. However, we need’‘think critically’’ about these data in order to be able to ‘’make important choices wisely’’. One of these important decisions concern how we represent the data.

We are especially concerned with ‘’the visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding’’(Kirk 2016). Representation relates to the visual depiction of your data, whereas the presentation relates to specific design choices of your visual depiction, such as the composition, the colors used, the interactivity supported, and the annotations provided.

When people view your visualization, they go through a process consisting of perceiving, interpreting, and comprehending (Kirk 2016). In reality, these steps occur in parallel. This first first is simply about perceiving, i.e. reading the chart. People try to understand the main features of the visualizations. In the phase interpreting, these observations are translated into meaning which also involves that people map their interpretation onto their own knowledge about this domain. Especially in situations, where people might not have enough knowledge in the visualized domain, a gap between the observation and the meaning might occur. This gap needs to be recognized and bridged. In the third phase of understanding people reflect on what the interpretation means to themselves. This phase depends especially on your viewers, since what might be a learning for one person, might be cryptic for another.
